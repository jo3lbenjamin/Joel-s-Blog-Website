        <h1 class="title text-center">Tips for the Self-Taught Drummer</h1>
        <!--Text here-->
        <p>I am a self-taught drummer and I know the struggles that you self-taught drummers face. So, here are
          the tips that I would like to share to all of you! This article also applies to all the other drummers but I am 
          particularly focusing on those drummers who are not going for proper lessons.</p>
          <h5>Read books!</h5>
          <p>Nowadays, there are a large assortment of good books to help you improve your drumming. Since, you don't have
            a proper teacher, read books, because it definitely will teach you! Most books teach about drum theory and in 
            my opinion, drum theory is very essential to improve your drum skills. Drumming isn't just about hitting the 
            cymbals/drum, but there are things like polyrhythms and 16th notes. Books help to understand those terms better.
          </p>
          <h5>Set Goals</h5>
          <p>Shoot for the stars! By setting goals, you are motivating yourself. It gives you something to work towards to and
            at the same time, it keeps you focused. Set specific, measureable and observable goals.  
            Once you set a goal, plan a practice schedule so that you can achieve that goal! Don't forget to monitor
            your progress too. Knowing that you have improved is very satisfying.</p>
          <h5>Practice Rudiments</h5>
          <p>Shoot for the stars! By setting goals, you are motivating yourself. It gives you something to work towards to and
            at the same time, it keeps you focused. Set specific, measureable and observable goals.  
            Once you set a goal, plan a practice schedule so that you can achieve that goal! Don't forget to monitor
            your progress too. Knowing that you have improved is very satisfying.</p>
          <h5>Hear other drummers play</h5>
          <p>Hearing other drummers play drums and learning about their style somehow helps towards improving your drummming.
            You can adopt their playing style and then twist it a little to change it to your liking. Sometimes other drummers
            can do fills that you have never thought of doing or they can add a groove that you never thought you'd do.
            Hearing other drummers play could add to your drum vocabulary.
          </p> 
          <h5>Play in a band</h5>
          <p>Get your musician friends and start jamming! Playing by yourself and playing in a band is very different.
            Before I started to play with other musicians, I thought I was a good drummer. I thought wrong. When you play in a
            band, you will learn that the music is not just you. There are many things for you to do. You need to keep time, your
            kick must be in unison with the bass, you need to use appropriate fill ins and etc! 
          </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>I, as a drummer, I cannot teach you everything. The list of tips above is not everything it just
            comes from my own experience. Now, I will leave the rest to you!</p>
