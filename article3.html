        <h1 class="title text-center">The Drummer from Nagaland</h1>
        <!--Text here-->
        <p>Never have I ever thought that a country like Nagaland exists! </p>
          <h5>Nagaland, What is That?</h5>
          <p>
            Nagaland is a country in Northern India. I was really shocked that a country like this exists in India. The people there
            are really unique and different from the Indians that you see in Singapore. I have always thought that all Indians have
            dark skin but in Nagaland, they look different. In fact, they look more Japanese than Indian! Apparently, they got this unique
            look because they are of Mongolian descent.
          </p>
          <h5>The Drummer from Nagaland</h5>
          <p>So, I knew about this country called Nagaland, because I met a drummer from there! Here is how I met him. I had a pianist friend named Tim who
            wanted to take his Indian friend out during Chinese New Year. Tim wanted to show and let him explore the Chinese New Year culture in Singapore.
            Tim then invited me because he knows that I enjoy going out during Chinese New Year. Shortly after, I met him and I met his Indian friend, named Kire.
            At first, I was really shocked to know that Kire came from India. I thought that they were being cheeky to me! He really looked like he was from Japan. </p>
          <h5>My Takeaways</h5>
          <p>I soon learnt that he is also a drummer. We then began talking about drummer stuffs. I have always had a habit of asking other drummers on tips because
            I really want to improve and I want to see what other drummers can offer me. Since he is from India, his style must be unique and different from the styles
            that are popular such as funk or R&B. He has a rather rhythmic style and he relies on flam strokes a lot. As a drummer, my style is that I use a lot
            of ghost notes and double stroke techniques but this guy is different. His techniques seems easy but it really is not. He also taught me Indian grooves
            on the Mridangam (Indian Traditional Drums). It was a really fun experience. I also got the chance to teach him on my style of drumming. He was quite amazed at me
            the same way I was amazed at him.
          </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>You will never know what other drummers can offer you. They might help you improve your drumming! So, when you meet another drummer,
            do not be afraid to ask them! I always ask other drummers. I do not really care if I seem annoying or not. I only care towards my 
            improvement as a drummer.
