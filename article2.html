        <h1 class="title text-center">Meeting My Hero, Handy Salim</h1>
        <!--Text here-->
        <p>I got an awesome privilege to meet one of my drum heroes. His name is none other than Handy Salim</p>
          <h5>My Inspiration</h5>
          <p>So why exactly, is he my inspiration? He is a really good drummer and he really lives by what he preaches. 
            He believes that without hard work, you can never achieve. A lot of times, there were moments where I really
            wanted to give up on learning a concept of drumming because it is too difficult. But I am always reminded by 
            what Handy Salim says. You can never truly achieve unless you put in your 110%
          </p>
          <h5>Meeting Him</h5>
          <p>One day, I was about to attend a concert. There was an Indonesian singer at the concert. His name is Dikta.
            He's a really great singer by the way. I was really excited because I never really go to concerts and this is 
            so called one of my first concerts. When the band, and the musicians, and the singers started to come in, I was shocked.
            I did not expect to see Handy Salim to be here at all! The concert was really a great one. Handy Salim is really
            smart and creative. He really knows how to serve a song and he knows how to bring the dynamics of a song.
            Instead of focusing on the singer, I mainly focused on the drumming! His drumming was so awesome. I was in awe
            throughout the whole concert.
            <h5></h5>
            After the whole concert ended, I really had to approach him. It was a one in a lifetime experience. I do not think
            that I will meet him again in the future, so I battled the crowd and approached him. Thankfully, the crowd was 
            too focused on the singer! I was really lucky. I then snapped a photo with him along with a friend of mine.
          </p>
          <h5>What's He Like?</h5>
          <p>Humble. He does not brag about his skills but instead, he taught me some of the fills and techniques that he used.
            He even gave me tips on how I can be a better drummer! The fact that he did this made me idolise him even more! I was
            so happy. He is a master at polyrhythms. He taught me some exercises that he follows. 
          </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p>Meeting my inspiration was awesome. I will never forget that day. I hope that one day I could inspire others, just like him.</p>
